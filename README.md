# Document Analysis and Clustering System

This project involves parsing HTML documents, extracting and tokenizing text, computing term weights using various methods, creating term-document matrices, and performing clustering based on document similarity.

## Overview

The project is divided into multiple phases:

1. **Phase One**: Tokenization of HTML documents.
2. **Phase Two**: Improvement of the tokenizer and calculation of TF-IDF scores.
3. **Phase Three**: Creation of term-document matrices and postings files.
4. **Phase Four**: Retrieval of documents based on query terms with optional weights.
5. **Phase Five**: Calculation of similarity matrix and clustering of documents.

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages: `beautifulsoup4`, `scipy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
